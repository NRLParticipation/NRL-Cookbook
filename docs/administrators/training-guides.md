# Training materials and onboarding guides

**Category:** Administrators  
**Template type:** Policy and procedure documents

**Collect these inputs before you start:**

- [PROCEDURE_TYPE]
- [Rugby_League_Club/ORGANISATION_NAME]
- [PROCESS_NAME - e.g., game day setup, player registration, volunteer onboarding, canteen operations]
- [Rugby_League_Club_NAME]
- [DOCUMENT_TYPE - e.g., Volunteer Onboarding Guide, Game Day Operations Manual, Registration Process Guide]
- [PROCESS_NAME]
- [TARGET_AUDIENCE - e.g., new volunteers, team managers, junior coaches]
- [DOCUMENT_TYPE]


Capture club knowledge in reusable guides that make onboarding easy. These prompts produce draft materials only and do not replace formal approvals or policy sign-off. Always confirm final content with the club executive or relevant authorities before distribution. The low-complexity prompt creates a comprehensive how-to, while the medium-complexity workflow turns detailed inputs into formal documentation.

## Low complexity: Procedure guide builder

```text
Act as a community sport documentation specialist. Review the process steps and club context I provide, then create a comprehensive [PROCEDURE_TYPE] guide for [Rugby_League_Club/ORGANISATION_NAME] that explains the step-by-step process for [PROCESS_NAME - e.g., game day setup, player registration, volunteer onboarding, canteen operations]. Include required materials, key stakeholders (e.g., coaches, managers, volunteers), compliance considerations (e.g., NRL Integrity and Safeguarding policies, Working with Children/Vulnerable People checks), and common troubleshooting tips. Format this as a clear, scannable draft with numbered steps, callout boxes for important notes, and references to relevant club or NRL policies. Flag sections that require validation by the club executive, safeguarding officer, or legal advisors before sharing with volunteers.

<STEPS>
1. Review the process steps and club context I provide.
2. Organise the information into a logical, step-by-step format.
3. Include necessary background information, purpose, and scope (e.g., how this supports club operations or NRL requirements).
4. Add relevant compliance requirements or best practices (e.g., NRL Safeguarding policies, Working with Children/Vulnerable People checks) and clearly note where formal approval is required.
5. Incorporate [Rugby_League_Club_NAME]'s terminology, culture, and values to reflect the spirit of grassroots rugby league.
6. Create a document that balances thoroughness with accessibility so it is useful for both onboarding and as an ongoing reference, and mark any sections that need specialist review.
