## Low complexity: Quick coach reminder prompt

Use this when you need an immediate email or SMS for outstanding accreditation records.

```text
Act as a club compliance coordinator. Craft a friendly reminder for a coach who is not yet accredited for a required program (Accreditation: [Accreditation Name], deadline: [DEADLINE_DATE]). Mention why accreditation matters for player safety and NRL standards and outline how to register via learn.playrugbyleague.com. Provide both an email version and a short SMS follow-up.
