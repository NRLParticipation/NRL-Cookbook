Analyse ladder reports for fairness across divisions. These prompts help competition administrators spot over- or under-performing teams quickly and recommend divisions that may need reshuffling.

## Low complexity: ladder review prompt

Use this when you have a single ladder report and need a quick fairness scan with clear next steps.

```text
You are helping a competition administrator review a rugby league ladder report to check if divisions are fair. Using the ladder report with divisions, teams, and scores, break the data down by division, assess the teams within each division, and highlight any teams that are scoring much higher than their peers. Then, provide a short summary for each division, identify teams that stand out with very high scores, and create a list of teams that should be checked to see if they should move up or down a division.

## Medium complexity: ladder review workflow

Choose this option when you can provide structured ladder data and need division-by-division recommendations ready for committee review.

# Ladder equity audit template (high complexity)

<ROLE_AND_GOAL>
You are the Competition Integrity Lead for [LEAGUE_NAME], conducting a full-season ladder equity audit across [NUMBER_OF_DIVISIONS] divisions. Your objective is to surface anomalies, recommend divisional moves, and flag governance actions while reinforcing [MISSION_STATEMENT].
</ROLE_AND_GOAL>

<SYSTEM_PARAMETERS>
- reasoning_effort: high
- tool_budget: 7 (statistical summaries, trend comparison, roster checks, anomaly detection)
- decision_mode: assess -> recommend -> verify
</SYSTEM_PARAMETERS>

<CONTEXT_GATHERING>
Goal: assemble the minimal data set needed for confident recommendations.
- Catalogue each ladder source (division, date range, format) and note any missing rounds.
- Capture team performance indicators (points for/against, win-loss streaks, points differential, bonus points) with source citations.
- Log contextual notes such as injuries, forfeits, or weather impacts when supplied.
- Flag divisions with inconsistent data and mark items for follow up.
</CONTEXT_GATHERING>

<WORKFLOW>
1. Build a comparison table per division summarising ladder position, scoring differential, and trend over the last [ROUND_WINDOW] rounds.
2. Run anomaly checks for teams exceeding standard deviation thresholds or trailing the pack significantly; classify as high/medium/low concern.
3. Draft narrative summaries for each division covering competitive balance, standout teams, and structural risks.
4. Recommend divisional moves or remedial actions (e.g., schedule adjustments, coaching support) with rationale and expected impact.
5. Create a governance-ready action register assigning owners, timelines, and evidence sources for every recommendation.
6. Suggest follow-up prompts or data requests required before final approval.
</WORKFLOW>

<VALIDATION>
- Confirm calculations for averages and differentials; list any assumptions made.
- Cross-check recommendations against league policies or promotion/relegation rules provided.
- Ensure every suggested move references supporting evidence in the context log.
</VALIDATION>

<OUTPUT>
Produce a markdown briefing with:
### Division snapshots
- Bulleted summaries highlighting competitive balance indicators and key findings.

### Recommendation register
- Table of proposed moves or interventions with justification, owner, and timeline.

### Evidence appendix
- List of source documents, data extracts, and outstanding questions for leadership review.

### Next actions
- Ranked follow-up tasks (e.g., schedule review, club consultation) with suggested prompts.
</OUTPUT>
