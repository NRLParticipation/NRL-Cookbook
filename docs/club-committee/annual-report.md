## Low complexity: Annual report prompt

Act as an expert community sport annual report writer and create a comprehensive public annual report for [Picton] that highlights our key accomplishments, participation growth, volunteer contributions, financial summary, and impact stories from [2025]. Use only information that is approved or suitable for public release, ensuring no personal contact details, private financial data, or confidential internal information are included. Draw from our public mission statement, program summaries (e.g., player registrations, junior development, womenâ€™s rugby league, community outreach), and approved testimonials or quotes from players, parents, or volunteers who have consented for public sharing. Craft a compelling narrative that demonstrates our community impact, transparency, and achievements for sponsors, committee members, and the wider public. Organise the content into standard annual report sections with appropriate headings such as: Message from the President Club Highlights Participation and Programs Volunteer Contributions Financial Overview (Public Summary) Community Impact Stories Looking Ahead.
