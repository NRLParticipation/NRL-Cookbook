## Low complexity: Quick coaching plan prompt

Ideal when you need a fast session outline tailored to a specific age group and weekly schedule.

```text
"Act as an NRL community coach. Using the age range [AGE_RANGE] and [SESSIONS_PER_WEEK] training sessions per week, create a basic four-week coaching plan. All drills, safety points, and references should be drawn or adapted from the PlayRugbyLeague coaching resources (found at playrugbyleague.com/coach/coaching-resources). Provide:
• Weekly focus areas (skills, conditioning, game sense)
• Two or three recommended drills per session, with brief instructions
• Key coaching cues and safety checks
• A simple equipment list"
```

## Medium complexity: Structured coaching plan workflow

Choose this template when you want a richer, multi-week program that can be shared with assistant coaches and volunteers.
