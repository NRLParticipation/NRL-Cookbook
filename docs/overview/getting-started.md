# Getting started

## About this guide
This guide will help you get started with OpenAI’s tools such as ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini.
It has been developed for rugby league volunteers, by rugby league volunteers to make AI simple, practical and relevant to the game.
Instead of facing an empty chat box, you will find ready-to-use prompts that tackle real challenges such as managing teams, running events and promoting your club, while keeping your work aligned with National Rugby League priorities.

## How the guide is organised
We group NRL Volunteer AI solutions into role-based problem types: Administrators, Club Committee, Coaches, Events, Marketing and Public Relations, Team Managers and Draw or Competition Creators.

Each collection provides three levels of support: Low complexity prompts will give you copy and paste prompts that work immediately in ChatGPT. Medium complexity provides structured templates with sections and model guidance. High complexity prompts are orchestrated workflows that combine planning, validation and follow-up actions.

## Draw and Competition Builder Tools
If you need to create or adjust match draws, head straight to the Draw and Competition Builder templates for MySideline-ready planners, weekend field allocation wizards that balance venues and operating windows, and gala day or template transformer prompts that accelerate bulk updates.

## Keep it simple
- Start with the template that best matches your current challenge. You can always return for deeper workflows later.
- Replace every placeholder (for example, [ORGANISATION_NAME], [MISSION_STATEMENT]) with your club’s details.
- Save the prompts that work well so your team can reuse and adapt them.

## Customising prompts to suit your needs
Each prompt is a starting point - adjust the tone, add or remove sections, combine ideas from different roles and keep iterating so the output matches the way your club communicates. Customisation tips and examples throughout the guide, especially in the medium and high complexity templates, show you how to adapt the workflows for real-world use.

## Why AI complements your expertise
AI is here to make administration, fundraising and game day preparations faster, not to replace the experience and judgement of your volunteers.

Treat these templates as starting points that your team can adjust to suit local context, tone and compliance needs.

## Privacy reminder
When using these prompts, please follow your rugby league organisation’s privacy policy and avoid entering any personal or sensitive details about members.
