# Getting Started

The AI Prompt Cookbook is your club or organization's guide to getting started with artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini. Rather than staring at an empty chat box, you will find ready-to-use prompts that solve real volunteer challenges and keep your work aligned with National Rugby League priorities.

## How the guide is organised

We group NRL volunteer AI solutions into role-based problem types:
- Administrators
- Club Committee
- Coaches
- Events
- General Tasks
- Marketing and PR
- Team Managers
- Others (coming soon)

Each collection provides three levels of support:
- **Low complexity** - copy-paste prompts that work immediately in ChatGPT.
- **Medium complexity** - structured templates with sections and model guidance.
- **High complexity** - orchestrated workflows that combine planning, validation, and follow-up actions.

## Keep it simple
- Start with the template that best matches your current challenge; you can always return for deeper workflows later.
- Replace every placeholder (e.g., `[ORGANISATION_NAME]`, `[MISSION_STATEMENT]`) with your club's details.
- Save the prompts that work well so your team can reuse and adapt them.

## Why AI complements your expertise
AI is here to accelerate administration, fundraising, and game day preparations-not to replace the experience and judgement of your volunteers. Treat these templates as starting points that your team can customise to suit local context, tone, and compliance needs.
