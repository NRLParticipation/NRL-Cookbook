# How to use the guide

## Quick start checklist
- Choose the role that matches your responsibilities.
- Open the prompt template that fits your scenario.
- Personalise placeholders with your club's information before sending the prompt to ChatGPT (or your chosen tool).
- Review the AI output and iterate until it feels right for your audience.

## Step-by-step for first-time AI users
1. Browse the role collections to find a challenge similar to yours.
2. Begin with the low-complexity prompt to see quick results.
3. Copy the prompt into ChatGPT and replace every `[PLACEHOLDER]` with relevant details.
4. Press send, then ask clarifying or follow-up questions to refine the output.
5. Move to medium or high-complexity workflows when you need more structure, collaboration, or automation.

## Tips for better results
- **Be specific:** include your club name, region, age groups, and program highlights.
- **Ask for revisions:** request changes like "make this shorter," "add a spotlight on volunteers," or "translate to accessible language."
- **Experiment:** try alternate prompts within the same section to compare styles or tones.
- **Keep a prompt library:** store the prompts that work best so teammates can reuse them.

## Stay mission aligned
Always sense-check the AI output against NRL policies, safeguarding requirements, and your club's culture. Use these prompts to remove busy work while keeping final decisions and quality control in human hands.
