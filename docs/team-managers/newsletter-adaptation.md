**Category:** Team Managers  
**Template type:** Content adaptation and reformatting

**Collect these inputs before you start:**

- [PLATFORM - e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn]
- [NUMBER]
- [LENGTH]
- [CLUB_HASHTAG]
- [TARGET_AUDIENCE - e.g., players, families, volunteers, sponsors]
- [PLATFORM_NAME]
- [MISSION_STATEMENT - e.g., grow participation, support volunteers, strengthen community spirit]
- [The actual social media copy, ready to post]
- [Brief description of ideal image or graphic]
- [Recommendation based on content type]

Turn longer club updates into scroll-stopping social content. Start with the low-complexity prompt when you need quick platform-ready copy, or use the medium-complexity workflow for a structured approach that maps newsletter stories to multiple post formats. *Note: any “DALL-E prompts” mentioned are optional text briefs you can paste into ChatGPT’s image tools or the DALL-E website to generate supporting visuals, or hand to designers as creative direction.*
