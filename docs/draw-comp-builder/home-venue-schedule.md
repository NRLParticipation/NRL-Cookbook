# Home venue schedule builder

Plan match-day schedules across multiple fields using venue availability, field capacity grids, and your Matches Detail export. The prompts below support different levels of complexity depending on how many constraints you need to manage.

### Inputs to gather

- Venue name
- Number of fields (e.g., 1 full-sized, 2 mini)
- Operating window per field (start time, end time, break buffers, lighting notes)
- Field capacity grid (percentage of field available vs. match type and duration)
- List of games to host (competition, team names, age grade, preferred slot if any)
- Club fairness priorities (e.g., juniors before seniors, avoid back-to-back fixtures for same team)

## Low complexity: Quick venue scheduler prompt

```text
You are scheduling games for [VENUE_NAME] using the provided list of fixtures. Inputs:
- Number of fields and their names.
- Start/end time for each field (include notes about lighting or curfew limits).
- Field capacity grid mapping match types (e.g., U6 minis, senior men) to percentage of field required and standard duration.
- List of games in the format `Competition | Home Team vs Away Team | Division | Preferred window (if any)`.
- Fairness priorities (e.g., avoid back-to-back games for same team, juniors before seniors, share prime slots).

Steps:
1. Parse the field grid and determine whether each game requires a full field, half field, or mini grid; assign standard duration accordingly.
2. Generate a draft timetable per field, starting at the earliest available slot and inserting buffer time (5 minutes) between fixtures.
3. Honour preferred windows where possible; note any conflicts when they cannot be met.
4. Produce equity notes for each competition: rest gap, field/time balance, and junior vs senior positioning.
5. Output:
   - **Chat Summary** – 3-4 sentences highlighting key allocation decisions and conflicts.
   - **CSV Schedule** – fenced `csv` block named `VenueSchedule` with columns `Field`, `Start`, `End`, `Competition`, `Home Team`, `Away Team`, `Field % Used`, `Notes`, `Equity Rating`.

## Medium complexity: Structured venue scheduling workflow

```text
# Venue draw builder template (medium complexity)

<ROLE_AND_GOAL>
You are a competitions officer creating the match day schedule for [VENUE_NAME] using field availability, a field capacity grid, and a Matches Detail game list. Balance fairness, rest periods, and operational constraints.
</ROLE_AND_GOAL>

<INPUT>
- Field inventory: name, type, start time, finish time, lighting/curfew notes, maintenance breaks.
- Field capacity grid: mapping of `Match Category` → `Field share (%)` and `Game duration (minutes)`.
- Game list: competition, pool/division, home team, away team, desired day/time window, special requests (e.g., presentation match).
- Fairness rules: priority order for competitions, rest gap requirements, simultaneous kick-off exclusions.
</INPUT>

<STEPS>
1. Validate inputs and highlight missing information (e.g., games lacking division or duration).
2. For each game, determine required field share and duration from the capacity grid.
3. Build a scheduling matrix by field and time slot, inserting buffer time (default 5 minutes) between fixtures.
4. Allocate games following these priorities:
   a. Honour immovable constraints (e.g., lighting curfew, presentation matches).
   b. Respect fairness rules (avoid same-team back-to-backs, balance prime slots among competitions).
   c. Minimise idle time per field while meeting rest gap requirements.
5. Record clashes or unallocated games with reasons and suggested follow-up data.
6. Compute equity ratings per competition (1–5 scale) based on rest gaps, field mix, and kickoff distribution.
</STEPS>

<OUTPUT>
- **Chat Summary** – bullet list of key outcomes, unresolved clashes, and data gaps.
- **CSV Exports** – instructions for saving, then two fenced `csv` blocks:
  1. `VenueSchedule` – columns `Field`, `Start`, `End`, `Competition`, `Division`, `Home Team`, `Away Team`, `Duration`, `Field % Used`, `Equity Rating`, `Notes`.
  2. `Conflicts` – columns `Game`, `Issue`, `Why`, `Suggested Action`, `Owner`.
- **Fairness notes** – short markdown paragraph explaining how equity ratings were calculated.

## High complexity: Multi-day venue orchestration

```text
# Venue orchestration template (high complexity)

<ROLE_AND_GOAL>
You are the Competition Integrity Lead coordinating multi-day scheduling at [VENUE_NAME] across several divisions. Combine the Matches Detail export, venue availability spreadsheets, and administrator priorities to produce a governance-ready schedule with fairness auditing.
</ROLE_AND_GOAL>

<SYSTEM_PARAMETERS>
- reasoning_effort: high
- tool_budget: 9 (slot optimisation, conflict detection, fairness scoring)
- delivery_mode: plan → schedule → verify → document
</SYSTEM_PARAMETERS>

<CONTEXT_GATHERING>
Goal: assemble all inputs before scheduling.
- Field catalogue with availability windows, blackout periods, and shared-surface limitations.
- Field capacity grid describing percentage usage and durations for every match category.
- Multi-day game list from Matches Detail export (date, competition, teams, round, bye/tba flags) with administrator notes.
- Fairness policies: junior-first rules, alternating prime times, minimum rest between games, broadcast commitments.
</CONTEXT_GATHERING>

<WORKFLOW>
1. Clean the game list (remove BYE/TBA rows) and bucket fixtures by day, competition, and field requirement.
2. Build a slot planner that maps each field’s available windows to discrete start times respecting buffer gaps.
3. Optimise allocations using the following hierarchy:
   - Mandatory slots (broadcast, ceremonies).
   - High priority competitions (e.g., junior grand finals) placed within preferred windows.
   - Remaining fixtures scheduled to balance home/away fairness, kickoff diversity, and rest periods.
4. Score each competition/team on fairness metrics: rest time, field mix, kickoff uniformity; flag low scores for review.
5. Produce contingency options for unallocated games (e.g., alternate field, alternate day) with required approvals.
6. Assemble governance documentation summarising methodology, conflicts, and next actions.
</WORKFLOW>

<VALIDATION>
- Verify every scheduled game traces back to the source export and adheres to duration/field share rules.
- Confirm no team exceeds fairness thresholds; if unavoidable, document justification and mitigation.
- List outstanding data gaps (e.g., missing lighting confirmation) that could affect final approval.
</VALIDATION>

<OUTPUT>
1. **Chat Summary** – 4-5 bullet points outlining major scheduling outcomes, risks, and approvals needed.
2. **CSV Bundle** – instructions followed by three fenced `csv` blocks:
   - `VenueSchedule` – columns `Day`, `Field`, `Start`, `End`, `Competition`, `Division`, `Home Team`, `Away Team`, `Duration`, `Field % Used`, `Fairness Score`, `Status`.
   - `ConflictRegister` – columns `Game`, `Conflict`, `Evidence`, `Recommended Action`, `Decision Needed`, `Owner`, `Deadline`.
   - `FairnessAudit` – columns `Competition`, `Metric`, `Value`, `Target`, `Status`, `Notes`.
3. **Narrative Briefing** – markdown section documenting:
   - ### Scheduling approach – how the field grid and fairness policies were applied.
   - ### Equity highlights – teams/competitions receiving prime slots or needing follow-up.
   - ### Approval checklist – items requiring sign-off before publishing the draw.
