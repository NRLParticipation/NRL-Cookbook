# Multi competition synchroniser

**Important:** Run the Single competition creator first and upload its output to ensure the premier competition draw is finalised.

This prompt generates companion draws for additional competitions (e.g., reserves, juniors) and aligns them with the premier competition so clubs play together where possible.

### Inputs to gather

- Premier competition draw (CSV from Single competition creator / MySideline format)
- Matches Detail export (e.g., `2025_Matches Detail Report (NRL Victoria Metro)_...xlsx`) if venue context is needed
- Teams report (e.g., `Teams Report.xlsx`) listing all teams, competitions, and club affiliations
- List of competitions to schedule and their team counts
- Club-to-home-venue mapping (club name → venue ID), including any neutral/centralised venues
- Fairness rules (circular round robin, equal home/away, minimal consecutive away games)
- Special scheduling constraints (shared venues, derby rounds, blackout weekends)
- Optional: club alignment priorities or washout weekends to mirror the premier competition

## Low complexity: Quick multi-comp synchroniser prompt

```text
You have already created the premier competition draw using the Single competition creator. Now schedule additional competitions.
Inputs
- Premier competition draw (CSV): [PREMIER_DRAW]
- Teams report with club affiliations: [TEAMS_REPORT]
- Competitions to schedule with team lists: [COMP_LIST]
- Club home venue overrides (club → venue ID or neutral venue flag): [CLUB_HOME_MAP]
- Fairness rules (circular draw, equal home/away, minimal away streaks): [FAIRNESS_RULES]
- Special fixtures or derby requirements: [SPECIAL_CASES]

Steps
1. Parse the premier draw to understand club grouping, weekends, and venue usage.
2. For each additional competition, build a circular round robin fixture list (double round if the calendar allows) and distribute byes evenly.
3. Align rounds with the premier draw so teams from the same club are scheduled on the same weekend where possible; use neutral venues when required.
4. Assign home venues using the club mapping, ensure home/away counts stay balanced, and limit consecutive away streaks (target ≤2).
5. Produce outputs:
   - **Chat Summary** – key alignment insights and fairness notes.
   - **CSV Draws** – for each competition, fenced `csv` block `MySidelineDraw_<CompName>` with columns `Round`, `Weekend`, `Home Team`, `Away Team`, `VenueID`, `Field`, `Kickoff`, `Notes`, `Fairness Score`.
   - **Fairness Snapshot** – list highlighting bye counts, venue hosting totals, longest away streaks, and duplicate matchups per team.

## Medium complexity: Structured multi-comp synchroniser workflow

```text
# Multi competition synchroniser template (medium complexity)

<ROLE_AND_GOAL>
You are a competition administrator scheduling supporting competitions so that clubs can host multiple grades together. Use the premier competition draw as the anchor.
</ROLE_AND_GOAL>

<INPUT>
- Premier competition draw (CSV upload or table)
- Matches Detail export for venue context
- Teams report (club, competition, team names)
- Competitions to schedule and team counts
- Club home venue mapping and neutral venue rules
- Fairness/policy rules (circular draw, equal home/away, bye balance, max consecutive away games)
- Special constraints (shared venues, derby rounds, no-game weekends, washout weeks)
</INPUT>

<STEPS>
1. Validate inputs: ensure every team has a club, competition, and home venue; log gaps.
2. Analyse the premier draw to determine weekend structure, club hosting patterns, and venue usage trends.
3. For each secondary competition:
   a. Generate circular home/away fixtures and distribute byes as evenly as possible.
   b. Align rounds with premier competition weekends, prioritising same-club teams playing together.
   c. Assign venues based on club home mapping, allowing neutral venues when needed.
4. Optimise fairness: balance home/away counts, minimise consecutive away streaks, share venues equitably, and adjust where conflicts arise.
5. Document any unavoidable conflicts (e.g., club playing simultaneously at single-field venues) and propose mitigation or alternative weekends.

<OUTPUT>
- **Chat Summary** – bullet list summarising alignment success and outstanding issues.
- **CSV Draw pack** – `MySidelineDraw_<CompName>` for each competition with columns `Round`, `Weekend`, `Home Team`, `Away Team`, `VenueID`, `Field`, `Kickoff`, `Notes`, `Fairness Score`.
- **Fairness report** – `csv` block `FairnessChecks` listing `Competition`, `Team`, `Home Games`, `Away Games`, `Bye Count`, `Consecutive Away Max`, `Venue Hosting Count`, `Club Alignment Score`, `Comments`.
- **Conflict log** – `csv` block `ConflictRegister` capturing scheduling clashes and recommended actions.

## High complexity: Governance-ready multi-comp synchroniser

```text
# Multi competition synchroniser template (high complexity)

<ROLE_AND_GOAL>
You are the Competition Integrity Lead aligning multiple competitions with an approved premier draw. Produce governance-ready schedules that maximise club alignment and fairness.
</ROLE_AND_GOAL>

<SYSTEM_PARAMETERS>
- reasoning_effort: high
- tool_budget: 9 (fixture alignment, fairness scoring, conflict resolution)
- review_mode: analyse → align → audit
</SYSTEM_PARAMETERS>

<CONTEXT_GATHERING>
- Premier competition draw (locked)
- Teams report listing clubs, grades, venues
- Matches Detail export for venue capacity reference
- List of competitions, team counts, and fairness policies
- Notes on shared venues, derby requirements, blackout weekends, washout slots
- Club alignment priorities (e.g., juniors with seniors at same venue/day)

<WORKFLOW>
1. Extract club-weekend patterns from the premier draw, including venue hosting frequency and bye placement.
2. Generate circular fixtures for each supporting competition, ensuring byes and home/away balances, and note neutral venue requirements.
3. Align each round with the premier draw, prioritising same-club grades sharing venues and weekends; compute alignment scores per club.
4. Assign venues, fields, and kick-offs while respecting venue capacities, shared bookings, and special fixtures.
5. Evaluate fairness metrics (byes, venue hosting counts, away streaks, duplicate matchups, prime-slot distribution) and compute fairness scores.
6. Record conflicts (e.g., simultaneous home fixtures at single-field venues) and propose mitigation or approvals required.
7. Compile documentation for governance approval, including recommended washout or reserve weekends.

<VALIDATION>
- Confirm each draw references valid teams and venues and meets circular draw requirements.
- Verify fairness metrics meet policy thresholds or document exceptions for approval.
- Highlight residual risks or data gaps before publication.

<OUTPUT>
1. **Chat Summary** – 4-5 bullet points detailing alignment success and next actions.
2. **CSV Bundle** – per competition `MySidelineDraw_<CompName>`, shared `FairnessChecks`, and `ConflictRegister` with noted issues, mitigation, and approval status.
3. **Narrative brief** – markdown section summarising methodology, percentage of club alignment weekends, fairness outcomes (byes, venue hosting, away streaks, duplicate opponents), and approval checklist.
