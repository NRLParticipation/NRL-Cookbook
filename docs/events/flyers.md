Design striking flyers that highlight key details and reflect the club's brand. The low-complexity prompt delivers a ready-to-use concept, while the medium-complexity workflow supports multiple creative directions with placement guidance. *Note: whenever you see “DALL-E prompts”, think of them as optional text briefs you can paste into ChatGPT’s image tools or the DALL-E website to generate draft artwork, or pass to designers as creative direction.*
